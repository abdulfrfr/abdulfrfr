Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a vital queuing service that empowers the decoupling of applications. It allows producers to send messages in response to events, with consumers pulling and processing these messages. Producers span a wide array of services, both on AWS and on-premises, while consumers mirror this diverse landscape.

**Types of Amazon SQS:**

* **Standard:** In this mode, messages are delivered and can be read instantly, with no strict order or consistency guaranteed.
    
* **FIFO (First In First Out):** True to its name, FIFO ensures messages are delivered in a specific order, adhering to strict sequencing and consistency.
    

**Key Features of Amazon SQS:**

* **Visibility Timeout:** Prevents multiple consumers from reading a message simultaneously. After a consumer consumes a message, a designated period of invisibility is enforced before it becomes available for another consumer.
    
* **Message Size:** Defines the maximum message size a producer can send to the queue.
    
* **Retention Time:** Specifies the duration a message remains available if not consumed.
    
* **Delivery Delay:** Allows scheduling the consumption of a message by introducing a delay.
    
* **Receive Message Wait Time:** Controls how long a consumer can wait when the message poll is empty, reducing frequent empty responses.
    
* **Dead Letter Policy:** Provides a destination for messages that cannot be processed.
    
* **Encryption:** Offers an option to encrypt messages at rest.
    
* **Redrive Policy:** Transforms an SQS into a dead letter queue for another SQS.
    
* **Access Policy:** Utilizes IAM Policies to dictate read, write, and management permissions for SQS.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) introduces a Pub/Sub model, where multiple subscribers can subscribe to one or more topics, enabling message publication to all subscribers of the relevant topic simultaneously.

**Types of SNS:**

* **Standard:** Aggregates messages without any strict order or consistency guarantee.
    
* **FIFO:** Maintains strict sequencing and consistency, adhering to a First-In-First-Out order.
    

**Notable Features of SNS:**

* **Access Policy:** Enables controlled access and permissions.
    
* **Encryption:** Provides encryption capabilities for data security.

In summary:

**Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service):** SQS acts as a message queuing powerhouse, facilitating the decoupling of cloud application components. It streamlines the sending, storing, and receiving of messages among distributed software components, with consumers actively polling SQS queues for message retrieval.

**Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service):** SNS operates as a dynamic publish/subscribe messaging service. It orchestrates the fan-out of messages to multiple subscribers, sidestepping message storage and sending messages to real-time subscribers, which can include AWS Lambda functions, HTTP endpoints, email addresses, and more.

One essential point to remember: An Amazon SNS cannot function as a consumer for an Amazon SQS Queue.
